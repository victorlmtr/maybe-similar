MaybeSimilar is a small project I've made because my friends and I sometimes share songs that remind us of other songs.

This app allows users to vote on whether they think two songs sound alike as well as submitting their own suggestions.
This project uses a a PostgreSQL database, a Node.js server (Express) and fetches video data using the YouTube API.

Frontend is made with React and Material Design.
